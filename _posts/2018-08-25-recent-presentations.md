## FP-Scanner: The Privacy Implications of Browser Fingerprint Inconsistencies

This paper was published at Usenix Security 2018.
I made my presentation in August, just after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGX7odA87k">James Mickens's amazing keynote.</a>
It evaluates different browser fingerprinting countermeasures and explains how some of them may be counterproductive.
